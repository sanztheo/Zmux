## Roadmap

Zmux is a native macOS terminal workspace with tighter Ghostty rendering, browser automation, notifications, and project context built in.

- **File explorer** — available now in the right sidebar for browsing the current workspace.
- **Git diff viewer** — planned panel for reviewing working tree, staged, branch, and commit diffs inside Zmux.
- **Docs and plans organization** — ongoing cleanup of product docs and design plans under `docs/plans`.

- **Browser import** — Import cookies, history, and sessions from Chrome, Firefox, Arc, and 20+ browsers so browser panes start authenticated
- **Custom commands** — Define project-specific actions in `zmux.json` that launch from the command palette
- **Scriptable** — CLI and socket API to create workspaces, split panes, send keystrokes, and automate the browser
- **Native macOS app** — Built with Swift and AppKit, not Electron. Fast startup, low memory.
- **Ghostty compatible** — Reads your existing `~/.config/ghostty/config` for themes, fonts, and colors
- **GPU-accelerated** — Powered by libghostty for smooth rendering

## Install

Build from source. Requires macOS, Xcode (with command-line tools), and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) on `PATH` to compile the bundled libghostty.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanztheo/Zmux.git
cd Zmux
./scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/reloadp.sh
```

`setup.sh` initialises submodules and builds `GhosttyKit.xcframework`. `reloadp.sh` produces a Release build of `zmux.app` and launches it. The script prints the absolute `.app` path inside `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/...`; copy it into `/Applications` if you want a stable location.

For day-to-day development, use a tagged Debug build instead:

```bash
./scripts/reload.sh --tag dev --launch
```

## Why Zmux?

I run a lot of Claude Code and Codex sessions in parallel. I was using Ghostty with a bunch of split panes, and relying on native macOS notifications to know when an agent needed me. But Claude Code's notification body is always just "Claude is waiting for your input" with no context, and with enough tabs open I couldn't even read the titles anymore.

I tried a few coding orchestrators but most of them were Electron/Tauri apps and the performance bugged me. I also just prefer the terminal since GUI orchestrators lock you into their workflow. So I built Zmux as a native macOS app in Swift/AppKit. It uses libghostty for terminal rendering and reads your existing Ghostty config for themes, fonts, and colors.

The main additions are the sidebar and notification system. The sidebar has vertical tabs that show git branch, linked PR status/number, working directory, listening ports, and the latest notification text for each workspace. The notification system picks up terminal sequences (OSC 9/99/777) and has a CLI (`zmux notify`) you can wire into agent hooks for Claude Code, OpenCode, etc. When an agent is waiting, its pane gets a blue ring and the tab lights up in the sidebar, so I can tell which one needs me across splits and tabs. Cmd+Shift+U jumps to the most recent unread.

The in-app browser has a scriptable API ported from [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser). Agents can snapshot the accessibility tree, get element refs, click, fill forms, and evaluate JS. You can split a browser pane next to your terminal and have Claude Code interact with your dev server directly.

Everything is scriptable through the CLI and socket API — create workspaces/tabs, split panes, send keystrokes, open URLs in the browser.

## The Zen of Zmux

Zmux is not prescriptive about how developers hold their tools. It's a terminal and browser with a CLI, and the rest is up to you.

Zmux is a primitive, not a solution. It gives you a terminal, a browser, notifications, workspaces, splits, tabs, and a CLI to control all of it. Zmux doesn't force you into an opinionated way to use coding agents. What you build with the primitives is yours.

The best developers have always built their own tools. Nobody has figured out the best way to work with agents yet, and the teams building closed products definitely haven't either. The developers closest to their own codebases will figure it out first.

Give a million developers composable primitives and they'll collectively find the most efficient workflows faster than any product team could design top-down.

| ⌘ K | Clear scrollback |
| ⌘ C | Copy (with selection) |
| ⌘ V | Paste |

## Session restore

Quitting Zmux saves the current session. On relaunch, Zmux restores:
- Window/workspace/pane layout
- Working directories
- Terminal scrollback (best effort)
- Browser URL and navigation history
- Saved Claude Code and Codex sessions, when Zmux has a resume token for the panel

If you need to reapply the last saved snapshot manually, use:
- `File > Reopen Previous Session`
- `⌘ ⇧ O`
- `zmux restore-session`

Zmux does **not** restore arbitrary live terminal process state. tmux, vim, shells, and other tools without a Zmux resume flow still reopen as normal terminals rather than resuming in-process state.
